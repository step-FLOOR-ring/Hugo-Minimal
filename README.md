# Hugo-Minimal
A minimal theme I built using Hugo, which has some basic ui animations as well as a persistent light/dark mode and is mobile friendly using local storage instead of cookies to handle whether light or dark mode is enabled on next visit.

By no means would I call it optimal as this was my first time using Hugo and I was jumping in at the deep end however it is definitely useable.
